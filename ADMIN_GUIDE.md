# Signature Admin — Content Management Guide

Access the admin panel at: `https://your-domain.com/admin`

---

## Logging In

- Go to `/admin/login`
- Enter your email and password
- After login you land on the dashboard

---

## Language Switcher

Every screen in the admin has an **English / മലയാളം** dropdown at the top right of the form. Use this to switch between languages when filling in content.

Fields marked as bilingual must be filled in separately for each language — switch the dropdown and re-enter the value in Malayalam (or English).

### How Malayalam works on the website

The website automatically shows the correct language based on what the visitor selects (EN or ML toggle in the top navigation).

- When a visitor selects **English** → the website shows the English version of all content
- When a visitor selects **Malayalam** → the website shows the Malayalam version of all content

**This only works if you have filled in the Malayalam content in the admin panel.** If a field is left empty in Malayalam, the website will fall back and show the English version for that field.

### Step-by-step: Adding Malayalam content

1. Open any Property, Service, or Hero Slide in the admin
2. Fill in all fields in **English** first
3. Find the **English / മലയാളം** dropdown at the top right of the form
4. Switch it to **മലയാളം**
5. All the same fields appear again — fill them in Malayalam
6. Save

Repeat this for every item (every property, every service, every hero slide) to ensure the full website is available in Malayalam.

## Collections

### 1. Properties

**Location:** Admin → Content → Properties

Used for all property listings that appear in the Gallery page (Houses for Sale, Land for Sale, Commercial Buildings & Properties, Sold Properties tabs).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Title | Text | Bilingual (EN / ML) |
| Property Type | Select | House for Sale / Land for Sale / Commercial Buildings & Properties |
| Status | Select | Available / Sold — changing to Sold moves it to the Sold tab |

**How the tabs work:**
- Property Type = House + Status = Available → **Houses for Sale** tab
- Property Type = Land + Status = Available → **Land for Sale** tab
- Property Type = Commercial + Status = Available → **Commercial Buildings & Properties** tab
- Status = Sold (any type) → **Sold Properties** tab

### Uploading images for properties — important

Images are displayed in a fixed-size card area on the gallery grid. The system crops the image to fill the card. To avoid important parts of the photo being cut off:

- **Use landscape (horizontal) photos** — ideally 4:3 ratio (e.g. 1200×900px) or 16:9 (e.g. 1600×900px)
- **Avoid portrait (vertical) photos** for the main/thumbnail image — the top and bottom will be cut
- **The first image** in the list is used as the card thumbnail on the gallery page — make it the best exterior shot
- **Minimum recommended size:** 800×600px. Larger is better for the detail page hero view
- If a photo looks cut on the website, re-upload a wider/landscape version of the same image

## Image Upload Guidelines

Understanding how images are displayed prevents photos from appearing cropped or showing dark bars around them.

### Why photos sometimes look cropped or have empty space

Every image slot on the website has a **fixed shape** (its aspect ratio). Your uploaded photo also has a shape — determined by how it was taken or cropped. When the two shapes don't match, the website has to choose one of two compromises:

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Photo fills the box completely | Edges of the photo are cropped off |
| Photo fits inside the box fully | Dark bars appear where the shapes don't align |

**The solution:** Crop your photo to the correct ratio before uploading. When the shapes match, there is no cropping and no bars — the photo fills the slot perfectly.

---

### Recommended ratios by image type

| Where the image is used | Recommended ratio | Example pixel size |
|---|---|---|
| Property photos (gallery cards, detail page) | **4:3** | 1200 × 900 px |
| Service images | **4:3** | 1200 × 900 px |
| Hero slides (homepage carousel) | **16:9** | 1600 × 900 px |

**4:3** is the standard photo ratio used by most DSLR cameras and many phones. If you photograph properties on a phone, check your camera settings — most phones allow switching between 4:3, 16:9, and square modes.

### How to crop a photo before uploading

**On Android:**
1. Open the photo in Gallery
2. Tap the Edit (pencil) icon
3. Tap **Crop** → select **4:3**
4. Adjust the frame and save

**On iPhone:**
1. Open the photo in Photos
2. Tap **Edit** → tap the crop icon (bottom right)
3. Tap the ratio icon → select **4:3**
4. Adjust and tap **Done**

**On a computer (Windows):**
1. Open the photo in Photos app
2. Click the crop icon → select **Aspect ratio → 4:3**
3. Save a copy

---

### File format and size

- **Format:** JPEG (.jpg) is preferred. PNG is accepted but creates larger files.
- **Maximum file size:** Keep images under **3 MB** per photo for fast loading.
- **Minimum size:** 800 × 600 px. Smaller images look blurry on large screens.
- **Ideal size:** 1200 × 900 px (4:3) for property images, 1600 × 900 px (16:9) for hero slides.

---

### Tips for property photos specifically

- **First image = thumbnail** — the first image you upload for a property is used as the card thumbnail on the gallery grid. Make it the best exterior shot of the property.
- **Order matters** — arrange images so the most important shots come first (exterior, then interior rooms, then land/surroundings).
- **Portrait photos (vertical)** — if you only have portrait photos (taller than wide), crop them to 4:3 before uploading. Without cropping, a portrait photo uploaded to a landscape slot will show dark bars on both sides.
- **WhatsApp photos** — photos shared on WhatsApp are compressed and sometimes resized. Use the original photo from the camera whenever possible.

## Tips

- **Deleting vs hiding:** Use the `Active` checkbox to hide content rather than deleting it. Deleted records cannot be recovered.
- **Homepage featured properties:** Only properties with **Show on homepage** ticked appear in the Featured Listings section. There is no limit enforced, but 3–4 cards look best.
- **Homepage featured services:** Only services with both **Active** and **Show on homepage** ticked appear on the homepage. 4 cards is the recommended maximum.
- **Sold properties:** Change Status to `Sold` on any property to move it to the Sold tab. The price will show with a strikethrough on the detail page.
- **Slide order:** If two slides have the same Order number, they appear in the order they were created.
- **Google Earth link:** Go to earth.google.com or Google Maps, navigate to the land location, switch to Satellite view, and copy the URL from the browser address bar. Paste it into the Google Earth Link field.
- **Malayalam fallback:** If any field is left empty in Malayalam, the English text will show instead. Always fill both languages for complete bilingual support.
